# Project Summary üìù

This repository, specifically the [ios_screenshots](https://github.com/ultralytics/ios_screenshots) section, hosts the code essential for automating the resizing of screenshot images into various required dimensions for Apple's iOS App Store listings. This simplifies one of the tedious tasks of iOS app development. An example of an application utilizing this utility is the "iSky" app by Ultralytics, showcased below.
